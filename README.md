# Get Started

1. **Clone the project**

    `git clone https://github.com/cryberg/react_expat.git`.

3. **Run the setup script**

    `npm run setup`

4. **Run the app locally**

    `npm start -s`

    This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. This command will continue watching all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt, linting runs, and tests run automatically. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.

# Goal of this project

The purpose of this exercise was to demonstrate the use of React and Redux by creating a Single Page Application that relies on data from a REST API.

To that end, I built something that will help me as I try to understand how Celcius relates to Fahrenheit in the real world.
